# Home Finance #
*A simple, open source, home finance tracking app*

## Note ##
This software is in development.  It may be useful to look at for seeing how to use JavaFX with FXML files, or see a simple DAO layer, or see how to use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/ "SQLite").

## Setup ##
* Requires Java 8 or better
* Requires Maven 3

"cd" to the directory you installed into and issue the command:

    mvn install

Alternatively, you can import the source into Eclipse or another IDE and make the project a Maven project, then build.

## Executing ##
Currently, the best way to execute is to import the project into an IDE, and run `net.snortum.homefinance.HomeFinance` as a Java app.
